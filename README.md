## Problems Caér Finance Solves

### Fragmented Liquidity
Traditional DeFi protocols often operate in isolated ecosystems, causing fragmented liquidity and poor capital efficiency. Caér enables seamless cross-chain lending and borrowing, allowing users to access unified liquidity across multiple blockchains—including support for IDRX (Indonesian Rupiah stablecoin) to promote stable local currency adoption in Indonesia.

### Slow & Inefficient Liquidations Cross-Chain
Cross-chain liquidations are often delayed due to latency, bridge reliance, and inconsistent execution, leading to bad debt and capital loss. Caér solves this with its optimized Application-Specific Sequencer (ASS), solver architecture, and Espresso-powered confirmation layer for fast, secure, and synchronized liquidations across chains.

### Security Risks in Cross-Chain Interactions
Interoperability introduces risks such as bridge exploits, centralization, and delayed finality. Caér uses a trustless execution model with a native sequencer and decentralized confirmation infrastructure, ensuring secure, verifiable cross-chain operations without relying on trusted third parties.

### Isolated Liquidity Pools
Many protocols limit efficiency by segmenting capital across networks. Caér aggregates liquidity into a unified layer, improving capital reusability and enabling optimized lending/borrowing strategies across chains.

### Limited Support for Real World Assets (RWA)
Current DeFi platforms lack robust infrastructure for RWAs, restricting institutional growth and off-chain capital access. Caér supports tokenization, collateralization, and cross-chain lending of RWAs while ensuring composability and compliance. With IDRX integration, Caér unlocks stable-value lending for Indonesia-based users and institutions, bridging traditional finance with decentralized markets.

This section illustrates the cross-chain lending and borrowing workflow in Caér, powered by the Lisk and Arbitrum networks. The system guarantees trustless execution, rapid finality, and secure interoperability through the Application-Specific Sequencer (ASS), Espresso finality layer, Solvers, and RedStone oracle integration.

Below is an overview of our cross-chain lending mechanism:

1. **User Collateral Deposit**  
   The user deposits 1 PAXG (tokenized gold) as collateral on Chain A (Lisk).

2. **User Loan Request**  
   The user initiates a request to borrow 1,000,000 IDRX stablecoins on Chain B (Arbitrum).

3. **Oracle Price Feed (via RedStone Oracle)**  
   Before loan approval, RedStone provides the real-time USD value of 1 PAXG, ensuring the collateral satisfies the required Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio.

4. **ASS Verification**  
   The Application-Specific Sequencer verifies the deposit on Lisk and uses price data from RedStone to confirm sufficient collateral. ASS cross-checks the deposit status and price data before approving the loan request.

5. **Espresso Confirmation & ASS Signature Generation**  
   Espresso’s decentralized finality layer confirms the transaction within approximately 15 seconds. After confirmation, ASS generates a signature verifying that the deposit exists, the price is valid, and the loan request is approved.

6. **Transaction Processing**  
   The ASS-generated signature is embedded into the transaction, enabling secure execution on Arbitrum.

7. **Solver Loan Execution**  
   The solver, upon receiving the verified ASS signature, releases 1,000,000 IDRX to the user's address on Chain B.

## Swap
![Swap Screenshot](https://caer-finance-on-lisk.gitbook.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2828639067-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FZHiot0VuOsTHqUwROATv%252Fuploads%252FN0c5jNt8J3mYNwsWHvyd%252F8.jpg%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D0f0079d6-06cc-425c-8e83-67defc3f5fe3&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=464e68ad&sv=2)
Caér implements a decentralized swap mechanism inspired by Automated Market Maker (AMM) models, enabling seamless token exchanges within the Caér Pool. Unlike traditional swaps, Caér’s swap system is designed specifically to trade collateral assets, requiring users to hold an active lending or borrowing position to access swap functionalities. This ensures capital efficiency and seamless liquidity management, enhancing the lending and borrowing experience.

Below is the workflow for token swapping and liquidity provision:

1. **Liquidity Provider 💧**  
   Liquidity Providers (LPs) deposit pairs of tokens (e.g., Token A and Token B) into the Caér Pool. In return, LPs receive Pool Tokens, which represent their share of the liquidity pool and entitle them to a proportion of the transaction fees generated from swaps.

2. **Caér Pool Management 🗃️**  
   The Caér Pool maintains reserves of the deposited tokens and continuously updates balances as users perform swap operations. Reserves are used to facilitate trades between Token A and Token B without relying on external order books.

3. **Swap Mechanism 🔄**  
   Traders initiate swaps through the Caér Swap interface by selecting the tokens they wish to exchange (e.g., swapping Token A for Token B).  
   **Unique Feature**: Users must hold an active lending or borrowing position to access swap functionalities, integrating swaps directly with the lending and borrowing protocol for enhanced capital efficiency.  
   The swap functionality applies an AMM formula to determine the exchange rate based on the current reserves of the involved tokens. Upon successful execution, the Caér Pool updates the reserves accordingly.

4. **Transaction Fees 💸**  
   A small fee is applied to each swap, distributed to Liquidity Providers based on their share of the pool. These fees incentivize LPs to maintain liquidity, enhancing platform efficiency and accessibility.

5. **Liquidity Withdrawal 📤**  
   LPs can withdraw their liquidity at any time by redeeming their Pool Tokens. Upon withdrawal, the provider receives their proportional share of the pool’s reserves along with any accumulated fees.

6. **RedStone Oracle Integration 📡**  
   Caér integrates RedStone Oracle to provide accurate, real-time price feeds for the tokens involved in swaps. These feeds ensure the AMM pricing logic aligns with external market rates, preventing price manipulation and ensuring fair value exchanges—especially critical for collateral asset swaps. During each swap, RedStone Oracle verifies the current market value of Token A and Token B, enhancing platform security and reliability.
